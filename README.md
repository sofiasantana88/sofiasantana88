# Hello Everyone! I'm Sofia Santana

I’m an aspiring Data Engineer passionate about transforming complex data into meaningful insights. Originally from Mexico, I’m currently pursuing my **Bachelor of Applied Science in Data Management & Analysis** at Bellevue College — with a concentration in **Data Engineering**.

My journey **blends data, creativity, and storytelling**. From helping local nonprofits in Mexico make informed decisions through data analysis to building my own analytics and automation projects, I’ve learned how to transform raw information into clarity, connection, and impact.

I’m deeply motivated by learning, innovation, and human connection. I speak Spanish, English, and French, and I believe that effective data storytelling is universal, connecting cultures, industries, and people. I want to turn data into stories, and stories into change. When I'm not analyzing data, you can find me reading or writing new ideas, playing video games, editing short videos, and volunteering and supportive communities!
