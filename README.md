# Hello Everyone! I'm Sofia Santana

I’m an aspiring Data Engineer passionate about transforming complex data into meaningful insights. Originally from Mexico, I’m currently pursuing my **Bachelor of Applied Science in Data Management & Analysis** at Bellevue College — with a concentration in **Data Engineering**.

My journey blends **data, creativity, and storytelling**. I’ve worked on building end-to-end data pipelines, ELT/ETL workflows, analytics projects, and automation tools using Python, SQL, and cloud platforms. From supporting local nonprofits with data-driven decision-making to developing portfolio projects in data engineering and analytics, I enjoy turning raw data into clarity, structure, and impact.

I’m deeply motivated by learning, innovation, and human connection. I speak Spanish, English, and French, and I believe that effective data storytelling is universal, connecting cultures, industries, and people. I want to turn data into stories, and stories into change.Outside of data, you’ll usually find me reading or writing new ideas, playing video games, editing short videos, or volunteering and supporting my community.
